# Japanese-Kana-Flash-Card-in-Python

The Kana Flash Card Tool is a straightforward educational tool designed to assist students in learning Japanese Kana, both Hiragana and Katakana. By continually displaying Kana characters in random order, it offers an engaging way to practice and reinforce your understanding.

This project is a part of school coursework and demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to language learning.
